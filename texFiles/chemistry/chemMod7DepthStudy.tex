\section*{Chapter 8 Review}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Explain why carbon is the basis for so many compounds.}
			Carbon readily bonds to other carbon atoms, and has 4 valence electrons. This allows it to bond with many other elements and is therefore used as a base for compounds.

		\item \textbf{Draw electron dot diagrams to show how single, double and triple carbon-carbon bonds form.}
			\begin{center}
				\charge{0=\:, 90=\., 180=\., 270=\.}{C} \charge{0=\., 90=\., 270=\.}{C} \\
				\charge{0=\:\:,180=\:}{C} \charge{0=\:}{C} \\
				\charge{180=\., 0=\:\:\:}{C} \charge{0=\.}{C}
			\end{center}
		    
		\item \textbf{Draw diagrams and name the geometrical shapes formed when carbon atoms have:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textit{four single bonds}
				\begin{center}
					\chemfig{C(-[2])(-[6])(-[8])-[4]}
				\end{center}

				Forms a tetrahedron

			\item \textit{one double and two single bonds}
				\begin{center}
					\chemfig{C(=[0])(-[3])(-[5])}
				\end{center}

				Forms a trigonal planar

			\item \textit{two double bonds}
				\begin{center}
					\chemfig{C(=[4])(=[0])}
				\end{center}

				Forms a linear structure

			\item \textit{one triple and one single bond.}
				\begin{center}
					\chemfig{C(-[4])(~[0])}
				\end{center}

				Forms a linear structure

		\end{enumerate}
		    
		\item \textbf{Describe, with examples, the difference between saturated and unsaturated compounds.}

			Compounds are considered saturated when all carbon atoms have single bonds. For example, methane only has single bonds, hence is saturated. An unsaturated compound has at least one double or triple bonded carbon atom. An example of such is carbon dioxide.
		    
		\item \textbf{Describe, with examples, the difference between aromatic and aliphatic compounds.}

			Aliphatic compounds have open chained structures, ie. the carbon chain has a ends, for example butane. These can also be branched compounds, with alkyls attached to the main branch.

			Aromatic have one or more benzene rings, with the benzene compound being the most basic

		\item \textbf{For each of the families of hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes and alkynes):}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textit{give the general formula}
				\item \textit{write the molecular and structural formula for the first five in the series; for the alkenes and alkynes, have the double and triple bond on the first carbon.}

		\item \textbf{Using specific organic molecules, distinguish between chain and position isomers.}
			Positional isomers are molecules that share the same carbon skeleton with alkyl groups rearranged. For example the following compounds 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane share the same five long carbon skeleton, however have methyl groups on different carbon atoms.

					\chemfig{CH_3 - CH_2 - CH(-[2]CH_3) - CH_2 - CH_3}
				\end{center}

			Chain isomers involve rearrangement of the central carbon chain. For example, pentane and 2-methylbutane both have the chemical formula \ce{C5H12} however pentane has a longer carbon chain of five compared to the 2-methylbutane
				\begin{center}
					\chemfig{CH_3 - CH_2 - CH_2 - CH_2 - CH_3}

					\chemfig{CH_3 - CH(-[2]CH_3) - CH_2 - CH_3}
				\end{center}

					\subitem Chain isomer

				\item \textit{Draw both molecules}

					Pentane

					2,2-dimethylpropane

					\begin{center}
						\chemfig{CH_3 - C(-[2]CH_3)(-[6]CH_3) - CH_3}
					\end{center}

				\item \textit{Predict and explain which isomer will have a higher boiling point.}
					
					\subitem Pentane has a longer carbon chain that allows more dispersion forces to occur in comparison to 2,2-dimethylpropane. Hence it will most likely have a higher boiling point.
			\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{The table below shows the boiling points for some alkenes.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{Calculate the molecular weight for each alkene and place into the table.}

					\begin{table}[H]
						\centering
						\setstretch{1.25}
						\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}}
							\textbf{Alkene}		& \textbf{Molecular Weight}	& \textbf{Boiling Point ($\degree C$)}	\\ \hline

				\item \textit{Graph the molecular weight against the boiling point.}

					\begin{figure}[H]
						\centering
						\includegraphics[width=15cm]{boiling_point_over_molecular_mass.png}
					\end{figure}

				\item \textit{Describe the trend shown on the graph.}

					There is a linear relationship between boiling point and molecular weight.

				\item \textit{Explain the trend in terms of intermolecular bonding.}

					Molecules with higher molecular masses have more atoms and can therefore induce more dispersion forces. More energy is required to break these bonds, hence molecules with higher molecular masses have higher boiling points than those of lower molecular mass.
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Compound X has a boiling point of −6°C. Compound Y has a boiling point of 12°C. Compound Z has a boiling point of −55°C. All compounds are from the same homologous series.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{List the compounds in order of increasing molecular weight.}

					Compound Z, compound X, compound Y

				\item \textit{Explain your answer to part (a)}

					All 3 compounds are in the same homologous series and therefore share similar chemical formulae. Therefore, compounds with higher molecular weight will have higher boiling points
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{A compound has a relatively low boiling point, but is able to conduct electricity and is soluble in water. Is it likely to be a hydrocarbon? Justify your answer.}

			No. Hydrocarbons are non-polar and have no dipole charge and therefore cannot conduct electricity.

			The R group represents a general molecule.

		\item \textbf{Identify the functional group, draw its structure and give the general formula for alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.}

		\item \textbf{Distinguish between an amine and amide in terms of structure and physical properties.}

			Amines are a functional group with a nitrogen atom and a lone pair in the form \ce{-NH2}. Amides form when the \ce{-OH} part of carboxylic acids is replaced by an amine functional group. Due to their \ce{N-H} bonds, both amines and amides have strong hydrogen bonding intermolecular forces. However, amides have a more polar functional group and therefore have higher boiling and melting points in comparison to that of amines.

		\item \textbf{For each of the following molecules, identify the homologous series it belongs to and write its correct IUPAC name.}

		\item \textbf{Compare the intermolecular forces and relative boiling points of the following classes of organic compounds.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit Alkanes and alcohols
					\subitem Alkanes only have dispersion forces whereas alcohols have much stronger hydrogen bonds, as well as dispersion forces. Therefore, alcohols have higher boiling points than alkanes

				\item \textit Carboxylic acids and aldehydes
					\subitem Carboxylic acids have a hydrogen bond between an oxygen and hydrogen, creating strong intermolecular forces. Aldehydes do not have this bond and can only form dipole-dipole bonds. Hence carboxylic acids have higher boiling points

				\item \textit Alcohols and aldehydes
					\subitem Alcohols have hydrogen bonding whereas aldehydes don't, therefore alcohols have higher boiling points

				\item \textit Amines and amides
					\subitem Both amines and amides have strong intermolecular forces due to \ce{N-H} hydrogen bonds, however amides also have a double bonded oxygen that allows strong intermolecular forces to form, therefore amides have higher boiling points
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Using examples from the alcohol, aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, amine, or amide groups:}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textit{explain the difference between chain and positional isomers}
				\item \textit{explain the term ‘functional group isomer’.}
			\end{itemize}

			A chain isomer involves variations to the longest carbon chain of the molecule whereas a positional isomer is a rearrangement of the functional group.

			For example, pentan-2-ol and 2-methylbutan-2-ol represent chain isomers as they share the chemical formula \ce{C_5H_12O}

			\begin{table}[H]

				\setstretch{1.25}

					pentan-2-ol						& 2-methylbutan-2-ol
				\end{tabular}
			\end{table}

			A positional isomer changes the location of the functional group, for example pentan-2-one and pentan-3-one, without changing the carbon structure.

			\end{center}

			Functional group isomers share the same molecular formula, however have a different functional group. For example, ketones and aldehydes have the same formulae, but vary depending on the location of the oxygen double bond.

		\item \textbf{Using the molecules 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol, explain the difference between primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols.}
			
			Primary alcohols only have one carbon attached to the carbon that the \ce{-OH} group is attached to. In pentan-1-ol, the 1 carbon that the \ce{OH} group is only joined to the 2 carbon. Secondary alcohols have two carbons attached to the same carbon that the \ce{-OH} group is on. In pentan-2-ol, the hydroxyl group is attached to the second carbon, which itself is attached to the first and third hence making it a secondary alcohol. Tertiary alcohols have 3 carbons attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group and is the maximum number of carbons that can be attached.

		\item \textbf{Explain why molecules like glucose are soluble in water despite their high molecular weight.}

			Glucose has a large number of hydroxyl groups, creating many opportunities for hydrogen bonding with water.

		\item \textbf{Explain why the solubility of carboxylic acids and alcohols decreases as the length of their carbon chains increase.}
			
			As the length of the carbon chain of carboxylic acids and alcohols decrease, the effect of the dipole induced by the functional group is weakened across the whole molecule. This causes its solubility to decrease.

		\item \textbf{Explain why the boiling points of organic groups increase as the length of their carbon chains increase.}

			As the length of the carbon chain increases, there are more \ce{C-H} bonds that induce dispersion forces. This increases the strength of the bonding between molecules and increases the energy required to separate them.

		\item \textbf{Explain, using a specific example, how a dimer forms between two molecules. Use a diagram in your answer.}

			Under certain circumstances, a pure carboxylic acid can form a structure called a dimer. 

			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=10cm]{depth_study_dimer.png}
			\end{figure}

			In a dimer, the \ce{C=O} bond creates a hydrogen bond with the \ce{O-H} of another carboxylic acid. This arrangement increases the boiling point of the acid as there are now very strong intermolecular forces between molecules.

		\item \textbf{Carboxylic acids are weak acids. Describe one way their structure can be modified so their strength is increased. }
			
			A more electronegative halogen such as chlorine can be substituted in place of a hydrogen. This weakens the strength of the \ce{-OH} bond. The proton is more readily available to be donated, hence increases the strength of the acid.

		\item \textbf{Explain why citric acid is considered to be ‘more acidic’ than ethanoic acid.}

			Citric acid has three \ce{-OH} functional groups, and therefore more readily ionises in water in comparison to ethanoic acid with only one \ce{-OH} group. This means that citric acid is more acidic than ethanoic acid.

		\item \textbf{Explain why tertiary amines have lower boiling points and decreased solubility than similar molecular mass primary and secondary amines.}

			Primary and secondary amines have \ce{N-H} bonds that can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules such as water. Tertiary amines do not have the \ce{N-H} bond and therefore cannot form hydrogen bonds. This reduces the boiling point and solubility in comparison to primary and secondary amines.

		\item \textbf{Ethanol and water readily dissolve in each other, as do ethanol and hexane. However, water and hexane do not dissolve in each other.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{Draw structures of each molecule and explain whether it is polar or non-polar.}

					\begin{center}
						\chemname{\chemfig{H -[1]O -[-1]H}}{water - polar}
					\end{center}
					\begin{center}
						\chemname{\chemfig{C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[-2]H) - C(-[2]H)(-[-2]H)(-[0]OH)}}{ethanol - polar}
					\end{center}
					\begin{center}
						\chemname{\chemfig{C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[-2]H) - C(-[2]H)(-[-2]H) - C(-[2]H)(-[-2]H) - C(-[2]H)(-[-2]H) - C(-[2]H)(-[-2]H) - C(-[2]H)(-[0]H)(-[-2]H)}}{hexane - non-polar}
					\end{center}

				\item \textit{Explain why water and hexane do not dissolve in each other.}

					Molecules must share the same type of intermolecular forces in order for intermolecular bonding to occur. Water has hydrogen bonding whereas hexane only has dispersion forces and therefore they will not dissolve in each other.

				\item \textit{Explain, using diagrams showing intermolecular bonds, why ethanol can dissolve in both water and hexane.}

					The \ce{O-H} bonds in ethanol can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, as well as dispersion force bonds with hexane.

				\item \textit{Considering your answer to part c, explain why ethanol is a widely used solvent in industry.}

					As stated, ethanol can form both hydrogen bonds through its hydroxyl group as well as dispersion forces. Hence, it can dissolve both polar and non-polar substances
			\end{enumerate}

		\newpage

		\item \textbf{Three compounds are known to be 1-propanol, ethanoic acid and propanone. Their boiling points (not in order) are 56°C, 118°C and 97°C. Match the correct boiling point to the compound, giving reasons for your answer.}

			\begin{center}
				\chemname{\chemfig{CH_3(-[2]OH) - CH_2 - CH_3}}{1-propanol}
			\end{center}
			\begin{center}
				\chemname{\chemfig{CH_3 - C(=[1]O)(-[-1] OH)}}{ethanoic acid}
			\end{center}
			\begin{center}
				\chemname{\chemfig{CH_3 - C(=[2]O) - CH_3}}{propanone}
			\end{center}

			Ethanoic acid has the highest boiling point of 118$\degree$C due to its hydroxyl group being able to form strong hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, it can form a dimer with itself, having very strong intermolecular forces.

			1-propanol will have a boiling point of 97$\degree$C as it can form hydrogen bonding through its hydroxyl group similar to carboxylic acids, however it lacks the polar \ce{C=O} bond that ethanoic acid has.

			Propanone has the lowest boiling point of 56$\degree$C as it only has dipole-dipole forces through its \ce{C=O} group.

		\newpage

		\item \textbf{Consider the table below showing the boiling points of various organic substances.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{Plot a graph of ‘number of carbons’ against boiling point for each of the three organic groups.}

					\begin{figure}[H]
						\centering
						\includegraphics[width=15cm]{chapter_9_review_graph.png}
					\end{figure}

				\item \textit{Identify and explain two trends seen on the graph.}

					In all the hydrocarbons, as the length of the carbon chain increase so does the boiling point. This is due to increased dispersion forces that require more energy to break the intermolecular forces. As well as this, alcohols have higher boiling points in comparison to aldehydes with similar mass. This is due to the polar hydroxyl group forming a stronger bond with other molecules than that of the \ce{C=O} bond on aldehydes.

				\item \textit{Suggest a more valid way to compare these molecules than by "number of carbons".}

					The molecular weight of the molecules would be more appropriate way of comparing hydrocarbons. The number of carbons present does not accurately correspond to the molecules' sizes.

\section*{Chapter 10 Review}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Identify the key features contained within a SDS}

			An SDS outlines the potential risks and safety precautions necessary when using a specific chemical. The document will identify the compound, as well as other common names for the compound. It outlines the chemical and physical properties of the substance, as well as storage methods. Most importantly, it provides an extensive summary of risks associated with using the substance in reactions and states methods of reducing risk, as well as responses in case of exposure.

		\item \textbf{Explain the need for a document like a SDS to exist.}

			The document is a necessary safety measure to ensure that chemicals are used safely in both laboratories and industrial environments.
			
		\item \textbf{With reference to organic chemicals, explain the difference between the terms "volatile" and "flashpoint".}

			The volatility of an organic compound is the ability a substance to evaporate to form a vapour. Flashpoint refers to the lowest temperature at which a liquid can form an ignitable mixture in air.

		\item \textbf{From question 3, explain how knowledge of those properties allow for identification of risks when using organic chemicals.}

			Highly volatile chemicals pose risks for inhalation related poisoning and pose risks when used. As well as this, chemicals with low flashpoints are highly flammable, a property that should be accounted for when storing and using such chemicals.

		\item \textbf{Explain the difference between inhalation, ingestion, and absorption of chemicals}

			Inhalation occurs by breathing in a chemical and is the most common method of exposure since vapours are easily inhaled. Ingestion involves the chemical entering the body by being swallowed. This is usually done accidentally when chemicals are not properly handled and are present on hands or clothing. The absorption of chemicals is when they dissolve through the skin and enter the bloodstream.

		\item \textbf{Compare acute poisoning and chronic poisoning with reference to organic chemicals. You should include exposure methods and general symptoms in your answer.}

			Acute poisoning occurs immediately or soon after contact with a harmful chemical. Someone exposed may develop headaches, dizziness, poor coordination and may lose consciousness. Chronic poisoning occurs after repeated exposure and can develop over years or decades. Symptoms from chronic poisoning are usually more severe and may include chronic fatigue, physical weakness, and liver and kidney damage.
			
		\item \textbf{Identify key precautions you can take in your school investigations to minimise risks associated with using organic chemicals. Link each precaution to a specific risk you are trying to minimise.}

			At school, highly hazardous chemicals are avoided in experiments to reduce the chance of significant harm. Maintaining ventilation or using a fume cupboard clears vapours from an area and reduces the risk of chemical inhalation. As well as this, gloves and safety glasses are required to ensure that direct contact with chemicals is minimised.

		\item \textbf{What is the name given to the type of reaction where the following occurs?}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{The addition of water to alkenes/alkynes}

					\end{center}

				\item \textit{the reaction of propene with hydrogen chloride}

					\begin{center}
						\ce{\chemfig{CH_2 = CH - CH_3} + HCl -> \chemfig{CH_3 - CH(-[2]Cl) - CH_3}}
					\end{center}
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Write equations for:}
		
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{the complete combustion of 2-heptene}

					\begin{center}
						\ce{C7H14(l) + \frac{21}{2}O2(g) -> 7CO2(g) + 7H2O(l)}
					\end{center}

				\item \textit{the complete combustion of propyne}

					\begin{center}
						\ce{C3H4(l) + 4O2(g) -> 3CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)}
					\end{center}

				\item \textit{the combustion of 2-methylbutane}

					\begin{center}
						\ce{C4H10(l) + \frac{13}{2}O2(g) -> 4CO2(g) + 5H2O(l)}
					\end{center}
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Write two equations to show different possible products in the incomplete combustion of butane.}

			\begin{center}
				\ce{C4H10(l) + \frac{9}{2}O2(g) -> 4CO(g) + 5H2O(l)}
			\end{center}
			\\
			\begin{center}
				\ce{C4H10(l) + \frac{5}{2}O2(g) -> 4C(g) + 5H2O(l)}
			\end{center}
			
		\item \textbf{Describe possible health issues with the production of carbon monoxide and soot in incomplete combustion.}

			Carbon monoxide is a colourless and odourless substance that is poisonous to humans, and therefore inhalation during an incomplete combustion is harmful. Soot particles can also be inhaled and restrict oxygen absorption into blood.

		\item \textbf{Describe the catalysts required for:}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{hydrogenation of an alkene}

					The hydrogenation of an alkene requires a metal catalyst like palladium to increase the rate of reaction.

				\item \textit{production of margarine}

					Nickel metal catalyst

				\item \textit{conversion of an alkyne to an alkene}

					A Lindlar catalyst, usually palladium deposited onto calcium carbonate, prevents the hydrogenation reaction from further reacting the alkene into an alkane

				\item \textit{hydration of an alkene}

					Dilute \ce{H2SO4}

				\item \textit{hydration of an alkyne}

					Mercury(II) compound and \ce{H2SO4}
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{When water is added to 1-butene, two possible products are formed.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{Draw and name each possible product.}

					\begin{center}
						\chemname{\chemfig{CH_3 - CH(=[2]OH) - CH_2 - CH_3}}{butan-2-ol}
					\end{center}
					\\
					\begin{center}
						\chemname{\chemfig{CH_2(=[2]OH) - CH_2 - CH_2 - CH_3}}{butan-1-ol}
					\end{center}

				\item \textit{Explain which product is more likely to be formed and why.}

					Due to Markovnikov's rule, when an asymmetrical molecule is reacted with an asymmetrical hydrocarbon, the hydrogen from the reactant will join the carbon that has the most hydrogen atoms already attached. In the example of but-1-ene and water, the major product will be butan-2-ol.
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{In addition reactions, there are times when only one product can form, and times when multiple products can form.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{Using specific examples, explain how only one product can form.}

					When the reactant is symmetrical, then it can be evenly split between the carbon atoms with double or triple bonds. For example, the molecule \ce{Br2} will be evenly divided and one \ce{Br} atom will bond with each carbon.

				\item \textit{Using specific examples, explain how multiple products can form.}

					When an asymmetrical reactant such as water reacts with a hydrocarbon, it cannot split evenly. In the example of water, due to Markovnikov's rule, the carbon with more hydrogen atoms will gain additional hydrogen atoms, however both products are still possible.
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Methane undergoes substitution reactions with chlorine under specific conditions.}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{Identify what specific conditions are required for this reaction to occur.}
					
					Alkanes will only undergo a reaction if sufficient UV light is present.

				\item \textit{Explain how this knowledge can be used to distinguish alkanes and alkenes.}

					If bromine water is added to a sample of an alkene, it will decolourise, losing its orange-brown colour and becoming clear and colourless. If added to an alkane, no reaction will occur and it will remain orange brown.

				\item \textit{Write a series of equations to show the conversion of methane to tetrachloromethane}

					\begin{center}
						\ce{CH4 + Cl2 ->[UV light] ClCH3 + HCl} \\
						\ce{ClCH3 + Cl2 ->[UV light] Cl2CH2 + HCl} \\
						\ce{Cl2CH2 + Cl2 ->[UV light] Cl3CH1 + HCl} \\
						\ce{Cl3CH1 + Cl2 ->[UV light] Cl4C + HCl}
					\end{center}
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{You are given samples of heptane and 2-heptene}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{Outline a method you could use to distinguish between the two samples. Include all chemicals used and what results you would expect.}

					Bromine water can be added to both samples. The heptane sample will maintain the brown-orange colour of the bromine water whereas the 2-heptene sample will become clear and colourless as the bromine reacts with the alkene.


				\item \textit{Identify one significant risk with the method you outlined, and how you would minimise its effects.}

					Bromine water has a harmful vapour that can cause illness if inhaled. Proper ventilation or a fume cupboard is required to use the above method.

				\item \textit{Write equations for any reactions that occurred}

					\begin{center}
						\ce{C7H14 + Br2 -> C7Br2H14}
					\end{center}
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Four bottles containing clear liquids were found on the laboratory shelf with no labels. The bottles are known to contain 1-hexene, pentane, water and ethanol. A series of tests were conducted on each sample and the results are shown below.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textit{Using the information from the table, identify which bottle contained which chemical. Explain your answer.}

					Water is not flammable, and hence bottle A contains water. Ethanol is an alcohol and is soluble in water due to its ability to hydrogen bond with water molecules and is flammable and is therefore stored in bottle D. Bottle B decolourises bromine with the absence of UV light and hence must be 1-hexene. By deduction, bottle C must contain pentane Bottle B decolourises bromine with the absence of UV light and hence must be 1-hexene. By deduction, bottle C must contain pentane.

				\item \textit{Write equations for any reactions that occurred}

					Combustion of ethanol: \ce{C2H5OH(l) + \frac{7}{2}O2(g) -> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)}

					Combustion of 1-hexene: \ce{C6H12(l) + 9O2(g) -> 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l)}

					Combustion of pentane: \ce{C5H12(l) + 8O2(g) -> 5CO2(g) + 6H2O(l)}

					Bromine and 1-hexene: \ce{C6H12(l) + Br2(l) -> C6Br2H12(l)}
