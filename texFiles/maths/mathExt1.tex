\section{Vectors}
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Definitions}
Scalar $\rightarrow$ A quantity that only has magnitude \\
Vector $\rightarrow$ A quantity that has a magnitude as well as a direction

Vectors can be represented geometrically by using a segment of a line. The size is the segment's length and the direction is indicated by a line and arrow.

There are three main notations of vectors: $\vv{AB}$, $\vv{a}$, or bolded letters (Uncommon, but part of syllabus).

When using vectors, only size and direction matter, not where the vector starts and ends.

The negative of a vector has the same magnitude but in the opposite direction, ie. $\vv{AB} = -\vv{BA}$
