	\subsection{Charged Particles in Uniform Electric Fields}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A uniform electric field occurs between two parallel plates of opposite and equal charges
			\item The potential difference between the plates, $\Delta V$, is measured as the change in potential over the field, not the value of the potential at a given point.
			\item It is the \textbf{change in potential energy} as a result of \textbf{work} being done on the charge
		\end{itemize}

		$$V_f - V_i = Fd = -Ed$$

		Moving a positive charge \textbf{against} the field requires work ($W=Fs$). When a charge is moved in an electric field it experiences a change in potential. The potential difference is defined as \textbf{the work done per unit charge}

	\subsection{Acceleration of Charged Particles due to an Electric Field}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Electric field is an electrostatic force, $E=Fq$
			\item The acceleration experienced by a charge is given by $F=ma$
		\end{itemize}
		\begin{align*}
			F &= ma \\
			E &= \frac{F}{q} \\
			F &= Eq \\
			ma &= Eq \\
			a &= \frac{Eq}{m}
		\end{align*}

	\subsection{Work Done on a Charge}
		Work is done \textbf{by} the field \textbf{on the particle} when the charge moves through a potential difference $\Delta V$
		\begin{align*}
			W &= Fd \\
			F &= qE \\
			W &= qEd
		\end{align*}
		\begin{align*}
			\because E &= -\frac{\Delta V}{d} \\
			-\Delta V &= Ed \\
			W &= qEd = -1 \Delta V
		\end{align*}

	\subsection{Acceleration on a Charge}
		In a uniform field, F is constant, $\therefore a = \text{constant}$
		\begin{align*}
			u_{\perp} &= u\sin{\theta} \\
			u_{\parallel} &= u\cos{\theta} \\
			v_{\parallel} &= u_{\parallel} + \frac{Eq}{m}t \\
			v_\perp &= u_\perp + a_\perp t \\
			v_\perp &= u_\perp
		\end{align*}
